## Disclaimer

## Breif Idea about Quiz App:
A ***Scholar Quiz*** app for All the Quiz Competation Conducted in Udacity Scholarship. 
</br>
Why It is Required ?
</br>
`Many students unable to get information on which channel and when the quizzes/challenge programs are being conducted. There are many and to remember all for when and on which channel are conducted is tough.`

### __Quiz App - Approach:__
 
Student will login into the app by mail or slack ID. 
On first screen, there will be a list of item for channels and lesson like lesson1, Lesson2, Hyderbad, git_gitgithub and more. (ListView & adapter will be helpful here )
When a student click on any item in the view, it will navigate to second screen. It will have list of quiz like quiz1, quiz2, quiz3 and so on. Each quiz will show whether the student appeared the task or not. If appeared it should show the score like ""7/10"". 
When the student click on quiz, it will navigate to third Screen, which will have objective type of question and answers.

Moderator and scholar program handler will have access to add new quiz to the list. When a new quiz is inserted, subscriber will be notified through app.
